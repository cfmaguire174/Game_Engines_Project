# Game_Engines_Project

# Project Title

Name: Conor Maguire

Student Number: D18124735

Class Group: TU856

# Description 
A Proceduraly generation landscape that the player would be able to build or deconstruct a house in.

The landscape will be generated using a noise map (Mathf.perlin()) and the house building will be box based like minecraft with boxes clipping to one another.

Hopefully different biomes can be added but this will be a later feature.
